own additions:
- added l7-dmenu-desktop script
    - includes .desktop files from ~/.local/share/applications/; /usr/share/;
      /var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications/; ~/.local/flatpak/exports/share/applications/
      if they exist
        - will build cache on make install (takes 5-10 seconds on my system)
        - after initial caching will update on change (fast)
    - includes aliases from ~/.config/l7-dmenu-desktop/aliases
        - syntax: alias <name>=<command>
    - removes entries specified in ~/.config/l7-dmenu-desktop/excludes
        - write one exclude per line
    - you need to install "dex"
    - to include regular binaries from PATH create ~/.config/l7-dmenu-desktop/addpath
    - to change menu that is used use --dmenu=<menu>
        - if using dmenu (not --dmenu=), arguments will be passed to it
